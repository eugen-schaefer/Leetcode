## Running code

### Dependencies for running locally
* cmake >= 3.16
* make >= 4.2.1
* gcc/g++ >= 9.3.0

### Basic build instructions for Linux
1. Clone the entire repo using HTTPS: ```git clone https://github.com/eugen-schaefer/Leetcode.git```
2. Make a build directory at the top level of the cloned repo and change into it: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `make .. && make`
4. Run the target of interest from the build folder: `./<target name>/<target name>` whereas the target name is the name of the problem from https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/. E.g. if you like run the solution for the problem posted [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/), execute `./ReverseInteger/ReverseInteger` from the build directory.
